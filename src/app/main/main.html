            This is the brand new project I am working on lately, started on 23/04/2015, that's 9 weeks from today,
            it is entirely developed in my spare time, as usual.

          </p>

          <p>
            It all began with this <a
            href="http://thepracticalsysadmin.com/running-elk-on-docker/">article</a>.<br/><br/>
            Was really exciting to see what <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> is able to do, ELK stack was
            quick
            and easy to build following the tutorial, but soon I though maybe we could do something interesting with the
            <a
              href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elastic Search</a>.<br/>
            So taking some random but useful data, in this case RSS news to persist on the Elastic Search, gave me the
            need
            for a Client/Server scenario, therefore it came the <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a> client
            and the <a href="https://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a> API to communicate the back-end docker-based virtual
            machines
            with
            the SPA Angular web client.
          </p>

          <p>
            At this point it would be nice if we could automate deployments and test coverage reports, I used to
            have a website online the last 3 years, it was completely unpleasant to maintain the dev/release cycle
            adding
            new features to the website and making releases in my spare time, including testing after the release.

          <p/>

          <p>
            I promised <a href="http://es.linkedin.com/in/sloppylopez">myself</a> the next project must have a CI-CD
            cycle, it was very easy to achieve using the
            wonders of <a href="https://travis-ci.org/sloppylopez/angularclient">Travis</a> mixed up with <a
            href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a>
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Backend_as_a_service">BaaS</a> features.<br/>
            If we include <a href="https://github.com/sloppylopez">Github</a> in the process, we have
            version control
            in a powerful combination that removes tons of boilerplate work and process failures in all the phases
            of the dev/release cycle.
          </p>

          <p>
            If we add 100% unit test coverage and e2e testing to the mix, topped up with <a
            href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/istanbul">Istambul</a> test coverage <a
            href="https://codeclimate.com/github/sloppylopez/angularclient/coverage">reports</a>
            and <a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/sloppylopez/angularclient">Code Climate</a> quality
            checks, we find ourselves with a project resistant to human mistakes
            across the whole cycle of dev/release.

          </p>

          <p>
            The project is measurable, paired with <a
            href="http://www.google.com/analytics/ce/mws/?utm_expid=71218119-7.lBgmrTO8R3uEDwsxNxa_Nw.1&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.co.uk%2F">Google
            Analytics</a> gives the interesting possibility of measuring
            the business value added for that feature, in that particular pull request.
            We can measure how affects the performance of the web with tools like <a
            href="http://gtmetrix.com/reports/sloppylopez.com/oMWRvOfo">GTmetrix</a> and how affects the
            <a
              href="https://codeclimate.com/github/sloppylopez/angularclient">quality</a> of code.<br/>
            if the pull
            request diminishes the quality, the deployment will not happen and Travis will automatically generate a
            report.
          </p>

          <p>
            After achieving this milestone we can focus on just adding business value to our project,
            that's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_management">Agile</a>.<br/>
            We built a bare bones seed, with the minimum number of features to make the whole stack work,
            which also is ready for future growth and unavoidable human failures.<br/>
            We also have a clear and well defined process that anyone can follow and is documented, idempotent,
            automated and generates reports out-of-the-box.
          </p>

          <p>
            This technologies offer corporations the chance to mitigate the need of certain roles and processes,
            they put a 'start-up' approach over the table since all the members of the team are involved
            in the dev/release cycle.

          </p>

          <p>
            Figures like 'Release Manager' as for example become less relevant in the process, the testing phase of
            the cycle gets partially released of stress as well, in a big corporation this can be a fair amount of
            money.

          </p>

          <p>
            The funny thing is that it possibly took Travis less time to verify if this website works, send a
            report to Code Climate and deploy the latest code in Firebase than it took you to read this brief
            introduction
            to this humble project.
